# STEP Files

!!! warning "Bleeding Edge"

    Please make sure to understand that while using onshape links to export STLs you are effectively pulling unstable and untested parts. Those are links that guide to live documents that change as EVA is developed.

Each project page contains an Onshape link to it's Onshape document. From there the parts can be exported to many different formats.

# Licence
EVA is released under GPLv3 which is a mistake I made in the past, I thought about changing that but it's too much work. With that I'd like to ask for you to consider the work put into EVA and if you are making money of it maybe donate some :wink:, at the very least please attribute by linking to this page.

Direct contact to me can be found on the [introduction page](/).
