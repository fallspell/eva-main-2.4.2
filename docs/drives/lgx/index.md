!!! info "Universal EVA Front"

    This drive uses the universal face, which means it's compatible with all hotends you can find in the Hotends section.

??? Question "What about LGX For Flexibles Set?"

    The decision was made, I don't want the front heavy - so called compact - extruders on EVA. Those do not fit EVA.
