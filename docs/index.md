## Platform

EVA is a carriage platform for MGN rail based printers. The main goal is to support what people may have laying around or have easy access to. EVA is trying to implement that goal.

The specification is described in a separate [EVA / Spec](https://github.com/EVA-3D/eva-spec) document.

## Download

The whole package can be downloaded as a ZIP package, otherwise you can navigate to the the specific drive, hotend or addon page and download files from there.

[Download :octicons-download-24:](https://github.com/EVA-3D/eva-main/blob/main/stls.zip?raw=true){: .md-button .md-button--primary }

## Support

Big thanks to the users - one example is that only thanks to your donations the Mosquito parts were possible.

If you want to support the project or just buy me coffee you can [:fontawesome-brands-paypal: Paypal.me](https://www.paypal.me/pkucmus).

In a huge part the project exists thatks to Rat Rig - they help me out with screws and nuts but also hotends and boards:
